# 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays
# You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.
# A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.
# Return the prefix common array of A and B.
# A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

class Solution:
    def findThePrefixCommonArray(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(A)
        seen = set()
        common_count = 0
        C = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] in seen:
                common_count += 1
            else:
                seen.add(A[i])
            
            if B[i] in seen:
                common_count += 1
            else:
                seen.add(B[i])
            
            C.append(common_count)
        
        return C
