├── README.md          # Overview of the repository
├── 2025/              # Main directory for solutions
│   ├── january/       # Solutions for the year 2025
│   │   ├── Number_problem-name.py/        # Solution files
```

Each solution is organised by year and month, with filenames in the format:

`Number_problem-name.py`

- **`Number`**: Number of the challenge.
- **`problem-name`**: A concise identifier for the problem.

## Purpose

This repository serves to:

- Methodically document solutions to algorithmic problems.

- Highlight the practical application of algorithms and data structures.

- Provide a structured approach to continuous learning in computational problem-solving.
